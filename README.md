### Developing locally

Run a local dev environment with one command:

`make dev`

When developing locally, you'll want to route your API requests to a dev server. To do so, add the following key to your `package.json`:

```json
"proxy": "https://platform-dev.percona.com"
```

### Running E2E tests locally

To execute E2E tests locally you need to set related environment variables first. By default `.env.local` file is used as a source,
so you have to create it from `.env`:

```shell script
cp .env .env.local
```

Then we should update `.env.local` with correct secrets.

To execute E2E tests just use `npm run cy:run`
